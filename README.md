# Honeywell Pressure Sensors

This Arduino library handles the [SSC][SSC] and [HSC][HSC] range of air pressure sensors from Honeywell with digital output only.

Product codes for supported parts will have S or 2–7 in the third-last position, e.g.: HSCDANN005PGSA5 is a 5V DIP part, single axial barbed port, 0–5PSI gauge pressure for dry gasses only, with SPI output.

The code is originally by Tomas Van Verrewegen <tomasvanverrewegen@telenet.be> https://code.google.com/p/arduino-ssc/

SPI functionality added by Alex Satrapa <grail@goldweb.com.au>.

# Sensors

Paraphrased from [the brochure][HSC-Datasheet]:

"The Honeywell TruStability® High Accuracy Silicon Ceramic (HSC) and Standard Accuracy Silicon Ceramic (SSC) air pressure sensors are piezoresistive silicon pressure sensors offering a digital output for reading pressure over the specified full scale pressure span and temperature range."

The SPI functionality in this code has used HSCDANN005PGSA5 as a reference part.
